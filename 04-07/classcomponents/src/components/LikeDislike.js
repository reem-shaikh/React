    // This TypeError is obvious now because this is pointing to the props object which doesnâ€™t know the existence of any setState function. The setState function is only a property of componentInstance.

    // So, to fix this problem, we have to bind the handleClick function inside the constructor:

    //to let the app know of the existence of setState we'll bind the app
    //binds this keyword which you can use later onclick
    this.like = this.like.bind(this)
    //this.dislike = this.dislike.bind(this)
    //bind bind whatever object you pass as an argument to the this keyword of the function

    //If your funcs don't require access to the state of your component you don't need to bind them.
    //bind will bind, and will ask the user to call it later, unlike call() and apply()

    //in the non bind approach, we'll use the arrow function
  }

  //on mounting of component 
  //same as useEffect with empty dependency array
  componentDidMount(){

  //allows us to access prev state and prev props 

  //useEffect we could pass the state we want to track in the dependency array
  //called immediately after update occurs

  //snapshot of virtual dom before its updated 
  //just before updating your DOM, it returns the virtual DOM snapshot
  componentDidUpdate(prevprop, prevstate, snapshot){
    //component re-rendered everytime state is changed 

    //this.state stores current state 
    //when we increment its on 1
    console.log(prevstate, this.state)  //0, 1

    //getsnapshotbeforeupdate to set the ref
  }

  //same as cleanup function in useeffect

    //this is cleanup of components, remove any event listeners if any
