### Advantages:
 React Router -> client-side routing, allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates. 

- makes page load fast 
- Browser is not reloading page, the data we want will be populated / will be added on a particular part of the page 
```bash 
On youtube, when we load a video 
and click on the youtube logo 
video minimizes to the corner 
while the youtube feed loads up 
this is possible because the page is not refreshing
```
### React Native
- android playstore apps are in JAVA. React native is built on JS, it helps converting JS to JAVA.
