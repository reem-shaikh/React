- When you want components to have access to some common data 

> How can we change data from one child component to another child component, without sharing data to each child component, we need a common place to store data so all components can access the data - context api 

- instead of passing props, keeping track of those props becomes hard, thats also what context api is solving by providing a common place to store the data. 

- redux is a third party library 
(and more powerful) , but context api is given by react. 

#### Creating context 
- method which helps you create context 
```bash 
React.createContext()
```
